Github commit rules: Use commit message "dev" for commits that are going to be squashed (i.e. not a full complete thought, just a check) Merge these commits together into a reconizable commit (such as "Added x feature" or "fixed issue #1302.)
Be sure these are squashed together before merging branch with master.
