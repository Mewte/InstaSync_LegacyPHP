InstaSync(h) in PHP
==========

Watch videos with friends!

This is the code base for the old instasync website, formaly known as instasync(h) (PHP).

Disclaimer: Only 1% of this codebase is used in production. I rewrote almost everything when the name changed to instasync.com.
This is mostly for nostalgia and a look in the past. When I wrote this code I was still very new to programming and web development
in particular, as can be told by my cute release notes.

This repo was made when I first discovered what source control was. So.. before this repo, I was only a couple of ```Edit -> Undos``` away from accidently deleting all of InstaSync.. on several occasions. Not that this has ever happened.. twice.

<p>
This was opened up to anyone who would find interest in it. No instructions provided.

Enjoy,<br/>
